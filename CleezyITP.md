# Claire's Assignment


##[things I could teach](https://github.com/bfl-itp/syllabus/blob/master/topics/introduction.md#exercise):
* a history of my life from my perspective
* the dynamic between my mother and I (from my perspective)
* how to draw on my eyebrows
* how to stick out your stomach so that it makes you look pregnant    and thus get good seats and avoid lines
