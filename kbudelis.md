#Hi, I'm Kris!

Before ITP, I worked at The New Yorker as a video/multimedia producer. I like stories and art involving photography and film, particularly ones that blur boundaries and genres. I also love cats, chai, camping, and alliteration. 

##I could teach: 
* yoga
* using a dslr
* making a documentary
* taking strong photographs
* using photoshop
* using final cut
* crafting a strong story
* making blueberry muffins
* making quinoa salad
* making kale salad
* making grilled cheese
* sitting ergonomically 
* carpal tunnel stretches
* intro to drones
* intro to drone videography 
* how to sew
* beginning french
